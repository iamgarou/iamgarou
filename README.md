- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iamgarou
- I'm currently studying Data Science at AlmaBetter, where Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in programming and analytics.

ðŸ’» Proficient in Python, I enjoy developing applications that solve real-world problems. I'm skilled in basic algorithms, data structures, and file handling, and Iâ€™m eager to expand my knowledge in data science and machine learning.
